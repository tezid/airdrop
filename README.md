# TezID IDZ Airdrop Distribution

This repo contains chain snapshot and code for calculating airdrop distribution.

The total airdrop distribution was originally intended to be IDZ 50.000 (currently set as variable in code).  
Due to massive interest we are looking at options to increase the airdrop allocation.

Airdrop date is planned for 26th of september 2021.

A new snapshot will be taken on that date allowing anyone time to verify their proofs before this date.  
Verifying your proof will increase your allocation.

## Run

```
npm start
```
